/*
 *For each test case, output a single line containing one string -"YES" or "NO"(without quotes); the answer
 *to the problem.
 *
 * You may print each character of the answer in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs","yes","Yes",and "YES" will all be treated as identical).
 * 
 * Problem Statement:
 *  kepler's Law states that the planets move around the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus.
 *  kepler's 3rd law is the law of periods, according to which:
 *  
 *     The square of the time period of the planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of its orbit.
 *     
 * you are given the Time periods (T_1,T_2) and Semimajor Axes(R_1,R_2) of two planets orbiting the same star.
 * 
 *     please determine if the Law of periods is satisfied or not, i.e if the constant of proportionality of both
 *     planets is the same.
 *     
 *     print "YES" if the law is satisfied, else print"NO".
 *     
 *     Sample Input:
 *     1.The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.The
 *     description of T test cases follows.
 *     
 *     2.Each test case consists a single line of input, containing four space-separated integers T_1,T_2, R_1,R_2T.
 *     
 *     Sample-1:
 *                      input          output
 *                      3              YES
 *                      1 1 1 1        NO
 *                      1 2 3 4        YES
